# PickMod

### Ask me to put this on Forge and I'm stealing your ribcage.
- If you're using sporefreak's resource pack, install the [Fabulously Optimized](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/fabulously-optimized) modpack. It's a fabric modpack that does everything OptiFine does, but better.
  - If you're lazy and really don't care, just use [OptiFabric](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/optifabric). It'll allow OptiFine to run on Fabric, at the cost of probably a lot of things breaking. I'm not gonna help you if you do this.
